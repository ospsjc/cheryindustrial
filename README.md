# Chery Industrial Shelters & Modular Homes: Affordable Storage Solutions, Expandable Prefab Houses, Industrial Equipment

Looking for affordable industrial equipment that actually delivers? Let me tell you about Chery Industrial—a company that's been shaking up the industrial supply game since 2013. They're not trying to be fancy; they're just focused on giving you solid, reliable equipment without the ridiculous markup.

## Who is Chery Industrial, Anyway?

So here's the story. Back in 2013, a guy named Jeff Zhang (you can find him on LinkedIn—he's the founder) decided the North American market needed better access to quality industrial equipment at fair prices. He started working directly with manufacturers in Asia to cut out the middleman nonsense.

Fast forward to today, and Chery Industrial has become this interesting hybrid—part industrial supplier, part innovative problem-solver. They've got five warehouses scattered across the US, which means your stuff actually ships from somewhere relatively close to you. No more waiting weeks for a container to cross the ocean.

What really caught my attention is their product range. We're talking container shelters, storage buildings, expandable prefab houses, portable restrooms, heavy-duty workbenches, shipping containers, gates, fencing, and a whole bunch of other industrial gear. It's like they looked at what contractors, farmers, and business owners actually need and said, "Yeah, we can do that—and cheaper."

## The Product Lineup: What They Actually Sell

### Container Shelters

These are probably their bread and butter. Imagine you've got shipping containers sitting in your yard, and you need to protect whatever's stored on or between them. That's where these come in.

The shelters use galvanized steel frames (16 GA or 14 GA tubing, depending on the size) and either PE or PVC fabric covers. The setup is pretty straightforward—you don't need to weld anything. It's all twist-locks and clamps.

**Popular sizes and prices:**

| Product | Dimensions | Frame Type | Price (Regular) | Sale Price | Features |
|---------|-----------|------------|-----------------|------------|----------|
|  [20'x20' Container Shelter](https://www.cheryindustrial.com/products/c20-series-container-shelter) | 20'L x 20'W x 6.6'H | Single Truss, 16 GA | $1,899 | **$1,590** | 300gsm PE fabric, rust-resistant frame |
|  [20'x40' Container Shelter](https://www.cheryindustrial.com/products/c2040-300gsm-pe-dome-container-shelter) | 20'L x 40'W x 6.6'H | Single Truss, 16 GA | $2,399 | **$2,199** | Dome style, weather-resistant |
|  [40'x40'x13' Container Shelter](https://www.cheryindustrial.com/products/gold-mountain-shipping-container-canopy-shelter-40x40x13) | 40'L x 40'W x 13'H | Single Truss, 14 GA | $5,700 | **$4,900** | Heavy-duty frame, large coverage |
|  [40'x40'x15' Double Truss Shelter](https://www.cheryindustrial.com/products/gold-mountain-shipping-container-canopy-shelter-40x40x15) | 40'L x 40'W x 15'H | Double Truss, 16 GA | - | **$6,799** | Extra stability, reinforced structure |

The double truss models are beefier—they've got extra support running through the interior, which makes them better for areas with heavy snow or wind.

### Storage Shelters

If container shelters are about covering what you already have, storage shelters are standalone buildings. Think of them as big, semi-permanent structures for storing equipment, vehicles, or materials.

These range from 20 feet to 70 feet in length. The frames are hot-dip galvanized steel, and the covers are UV-resistant, water-resistant, and fire-retardant. They come with roll-up doors you operate by hand winch, plus built-in side doors.

👉 [Browse Storage Shelters](https://www.cheryindustrial.com/collections/storage-shelter) - prices typically range from $5,000 to $15,000 depending on size and specifications.

### Expandable Prefab Houses

This is where things get interesting. These aren't your typical tiny homes—they're expandable container houses that fold out.

The concept is simple: the house arrives folded up, you unfold it (usually takes a few hours with a small crew), and suddenly you've got a livable space with bathroom, kitchen area, and sleeping quarters.

**Expandable Prefab House Options:**

| Product | Dimensions | Living Area | Bedroom/Bath | Price |
|---------|-----------|-------------|--------------|-------|
|  [13ft x 20ft Prefab House](https://www.cheryindustrial.com/products/bastone-mobile-expandable-prefab-house-13ft-x-20ft) | 13'W x 20'L | 276.1 sq ft | 1 bed, 1 bath | **$23,000** |
|  [15ft x 20ft Tiny Home](https://www.cheryindustrial.com/products/bastone-mobile-expandable-prefab-house-15ft-x-20ft) | 15'W x 20'L | 302.3 sq ft | 1 bed, 0 bath | **$12,990** (was $17,600) |
|  [16½ft x 20ft Prefab House](https://www.cheryindustrial.com/products/bastone-mobile-expandable-prefab-house-16-ft-x-20ft) | 16.5'W x 20'L | 336.3 sq ft | 0 bed, 0 bath | **$21,999** |
|  [19ft x 20ft Prefab Home](https://www.cheryindustrial.com/products/mobile-house) | 19'W x 20'L | 409.8 sq ft | 1 bed, 1 bath | **$28,990** |
|  [19ft x 20ft with Cabinet](https://www.cheryindustrial.com/products/bastone-mobile-expandable-prefab-house-19ft-x-20ft-with-cabinet) | 19'W x 20'L | 380 sq ft | 1 bed, 1 bath | **$30,500** |

These have been getting attention from publications like Fortune, Newsweek, and Yahoo Finance. The appeal? You can get a functional living space for way less than traditional construction costs.

### Portable Restrooms

For construction sites, events, or remote work locations, Chery Industrial offers fully equipped portable bathroom units. These aren't those plastic port-a-potties you see at festivals. We're talking actual bathrooms with flush toilets, sinks, and in some models, full showers.

**Portable Restroom Pricing:**

| Product | Features | Price (Regular) | Sale Price |
|---------|----------|-----------------|------------|
|  [Restroom with Sink](https://www.cheryindustrial.com/products/bastone-portable-restroom-with-sink) | 1 toilet, 1 sink | $3,899 | **$2,799** |

### Heavy Duty Workbenches

Their workbench lineup is pretty impressive—these are serious garage and workshop setups with tons of drawer space.

The 👉 [7ft workbench with 20 drawers](https://www.cheryindustrial.com/products/7-ft-work-bench-with-20-drawers) is currently on sale for **$2,299** (regularly $2,699), and the 👉 [10ft workbench with 25 drawers](https://www.cheryindustrial.com/products/10-ft-work-bench-with-25-drawers) goes for **$2,899** (was $3,199).

## What Do Customers Actually Think?

Let's be real here—customer reviews are mixed, which is pretty standard for a company selling industrial equipment online.

**The Good Stuff:**

On Judge.me, they're sitting at 4.8 out of 5 stars based on 673 reviews. On Trustpilot, they've got a 4-star rating from 82 reviewers. People consistently praise:

- Competitive pricing compared to other suppliers
- Product quality and durability once assembled
- Responsive customer service (when you can reach them)
- Fast shipping from their multiple US warehouses

One customer on Trustpilot wrote: "Great customer service with quick replies to emails. Well informed about product delivery and delivered on time. Replacements provided for damaged parts."

Another mentioned: "Helpful & patient salesman; first rate, friendly warehouseman. Good discount on a quality product."

**The Not-So-Good:**

BBB has them at a lower rating (around 1.17/5 from customer reviews, though they're BBB accredited with a B+ rating). Common complaints include:

- Assembly instructions could be clearer
- Occasional missing parts (though they do send replacements)
- Customer service response times can vary
- Some products arrive with minor shipping damage

The thing is, most of these issues seem related to the complexities of shipping and assembling large industrial products rather than fundamental quality problems. When parts are missing or damaged, the company does appear to make it right, though the process might take longer than ideal.

## Who's Actually Buying This Stuff?

Looking at their client list, Chery Industrial serves some pretty serious customers. We're talking NASA, Cal Fire, U-Haul, Equipment Share, Estée Lauder, Yokohama, GMC, Navistar, GE, Kiewit, US Coast Guard, Bechtel, Ferguson, and others.

That tells you something about the quality level. These aren't the kinds of organizations that buy cheap junk.

## The Bottom Line: Is Chery Industrial Worth It?

Here's my take after digging through all this information:

If you need industrial equipment and you're budget-conscious, Chery Industrial is worth serious consideration. Their prices are competitive—sometimes significantly lower than what you'd find elsewhere. The quality seems solid for the price point, though you might encounter some assembly challenges or occasional shipping issues.

The expandable prefab houses are particularly interesting. At $12,990 to $30,500, they're way cheaper than traditional construction and could work great as guest houses, home offices, rental units, or even primary residences in areas with lower housing costs.

For container shelters and storage buildings, the value proposition is clear: you're getting weather-resistant protection for equipment and materials at a fraction of what you'd pay for a permanent structure.

Just go in with realistic expectations. This isn't boutique, white-glove service. It's industrial equipment at industrial prices with industrial-level complexity. If you can handle some assembly challenges and potentially need to chase down a missing bolt or two, you'll probably be happy with what you get.

And seriously—use those promo codes. With discounts up to 15% off plus free shipping over $1,000, you can save some real money.
